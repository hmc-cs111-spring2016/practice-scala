/**
 * This exercise introduces you to the powerful pattern matching features of Scala.
 *
 * Pattern matching can in its essence be compared to Java's 'switch' statement,
 * even though it provides many more possibilites. Whereas the Java switch statmenet
 * lets you 'match' primitive types up to int's, Scala's pattern matching goes much
 * further. Practically everything from all types of objects and Collections
 * can be matched, not forgetting xml and a special type of class called case classes.
 *
 * Pattern matching is also often used in combination with recursive algorithms.
 *
 * For this exercise exclusively use pattern matching constructs in order to make the
 * corresponding unit test work.

   * Here's how matches should work. If `in` is:

   *    - a `String`, the function result is "A string with length n"
   *       where `n` is the length of `in`
   *       
   *    - a positive `Integer`, the function result is "A positive integer"
   *    
   *    - an instance of class `Person`, the function result is "A person with name: n"
   *       where `n` is the name of the person
   *       
   *    - a sequence with more than 10 elements, the function result is "Seq with more than 10 elements"
   *    
   *    - a sequence with at least three elements, the function result is "first: v1, second: v2, rest: tail"
   *        where v1, v2, and tail are the corresponding values from the sequence
   *        
   *    - null, the function result is "A null value"
   *        
   *    - anything else, the function result is "Some Scala class"
