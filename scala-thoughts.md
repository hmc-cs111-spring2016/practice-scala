Note: I did this on Thursday because I completely forgot about it until I started my peer review.

Scala is such an interesting language. I found it frusterating to learn because there appeared to be so many ways to do things and many pieces of example code that I found did things in very different ways. However, as I began to grow accustomed to various features I began to enjoy the versatility that gave me. I particularly liked the wide range of ways I found to use pattern matching and recursion to solve problems. It felt very reminescent of Racket. I have used switch cases in Java but never found them super useful. In Scala, the match cases are so versatile that I could use them to replace many embedded if and if elses for clearer and more concise code and simpler program flow.  I found that especially with lists, there were so many built in functions that many of the problems could be done in one line of code by just combining a few of them, which is so much easier than when I have tried to do such things in Java.
