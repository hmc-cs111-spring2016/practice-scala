Scala is an incredibly powerful language that I really enjoyed using through 
these exercises. Although I have worked with quite a bit of Scala code before
this assignment, I haven't had the opportunity to write much of it from 
scratch. Additionally, I haven't worked with Scala much since completing PLs
last semester. Some of the "quirky" nature of Scala makes much more sense after
having implemented a type checker and made extensive use of Haskell in CS131.

For instance, although the rules for verboseness seemed arbitrary the first
time I worked with Scala, I now have a much better idea of when I need '()' or
a '.', etc. This comes from understanding how a type checker would attempt to
infer types. Additionally the value of "no side effects" makes a lot more sense
after coming off of using the ultimate "no side effects" language, Haskell.

I personally think Scala is better than Haskell (for at least
my purposes). This is because Scala, by also supporting Object Oriented
Programming, allows convenient solutions that Haskell needed elaborate work
arounds for. For instance, although the Haskell designers found a clever way
to allow printing through Monads without violating fundamental principles of
the language, this felt more like a "hack" to allow necessary functionality.
In some respects, although lazy evaluation and no side effects has some
wonderful benefits, Haskell's practicality feels hampered in some ways by its
mathematical beauty. Scala, from what I can tell, doesn't suffer from this
since it takes the middle ground on all aspects of Object Oriented Programming
and Functional Programming.

That being said, Scala seems to also have its own short comings. I've never
felt a programming language had as much relevance as Scala to the words
of Spiderman's Uncle Ben, "With great power comes great responsibility!" This
is because Scala gives the programmer a ton of freedom. But this freedom comes
with a heavy burden the programmer must be carry. Since it feels like there
is almost 10 ways to write just about everything, that means there is probably
9 ways to write something bad and 1 way to write it good. This means keeping
to standard practices is very important to keep your code readable in Scala.

Regardless, the power of Scala seems to be worth the cost since good 
programming practices should be followed for any language. Although Scala
in some ways feels like a more "academic" language, like Haskell, it
also manages to feel practical. I look forward to learning more about the
language. I also hear there is a very powerful macro system with Scala
that I am interested in learning more about.
