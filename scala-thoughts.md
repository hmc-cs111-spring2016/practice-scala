<h3> What's Easy/Difficult? </h3>
Overall, the list functions are also pretty easy to use. There's a wide variety of them built in that can handle many basic
functions. As for what's difficult, I'm not sure that I have a good sense of how the abstract classes work. That part seemed
a bit obscure to me. It also took me a while to get a hang of OOP in Scala. This might be because I'm rusty, but I thought 
a lot of the documentation wasn't very clear. I also don't feel like I
have a good sense of how to write conditions for some of the list functions, like mapping/filter/etc. 

<h3> Favorite Language Design Choices </h3>
One of the things I've noticed about Scala thus far is that it doesn't have nearly as much extra syntax as other languages. 
For example, there aren't semi colons needed or the word "return" explcitly written out. This is convenient for readability. 

<h3> Least Favorite Design Choices </h3>
However, I don't like the way the typing is set up when defining parameters. I find it hard
to read at a glance and quickly figure out what's going on. I think that the designers probably did this because of their
non-conventional implementation of returns (the implicit return), but I still found it difficult to work with.

I didn't get to play around with cases that much as I was unable to finish the assignment. I would like to get a better sense
of those, given that they seem important to a lot of the more interesting applications of Scala.
