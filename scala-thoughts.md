In theory, I think, it's pretty easy to do in Scala anything that's easy to do in Java. Some of that may not be "good" Scala, though. Basic object-oriented programming, for example isn't any more difficult (even if the idea of companion objects is kind of weird at first). Functional programming is pretty easy in Scala as well, although I was surprised to find that higher-order functions are typically methods of types for which those functions make any sense. I found that it was
quite difficult to use recursion and pattern-matching to do something better handled without the pattern-matching. In particular, I basically gave up figuring out how to implement zipMultiple with pattern-matching, looked at the sample solution, realized _why_ I hadn't figured it out (it was considerably more complicated than I think is necessary), and ended up just referring to Prof. Ben's solution. Obviously there are going to be some tasks that pattern matching won't be suited for regardless of the
language, but I'm not sure whether this is one of them, or if Scala's pattern matching is particularly not suited to it.

I'd really like to learn more about implicit definitions and classes, since I don't really understand what they're actually for or how best to use them. It seems kind of like you could give a DSL pseudo-dynamic typing if you write enough implicit behavior for it, which might be useful in some cases.
