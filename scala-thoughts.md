## What is easy to do in Scala
A lot of things are really easy to do if you know how to do them. There are many specialized funcitons for every area from list processing to funtion calling. Many things that would take entire methods to do in some languages only take a single line in Scala. I really think that this is because of the extensive library that Scala seems to have. Additionally, it is built on top of the Java library so anything you can do in Scala, you can do in Java. I guess that makes it easy to do anything you know how to do in Java. 

## What is not easy to do in Scala
I think the hardest part of Scala is finding the most elegant way to do a task. It is possible to do everything the old fashioned way. For example, you can create lists and loop through them with for loops and do anything you would do in a more familiar language such as Java or C++. However, you always know in the back of your mind that there is a better more Scala-y way that can sometimes be difficult to find because there are just so many ways of doing a particular task. 

## On multiple ways to say the same thing
I really think that this is inherently a good thing. The language may come off as very large and bulky but when you look at the learning curve, it's all worth it. Beginners in Scala already know how to write full 'Scala' programs if they've come from a Java background so there's virtually no learning curve. As you spend more time in Scala, you pick up more efficient strategies to improve your code by using more of Scala's built in features. Eventually I would imagine that if you become a Scala expert, writing code would be very elegant. It is nice to have a learning curve where at every point, you still have full programming ability. You are never at a loss for how to express an idea, you are only at a loss for how to express an idea in the best way possible. Although not being able to find the best way may be annoying at times, it also provides a learning oppourtunity. 

## Scala feature that I did not like
I do not particularly like in Scala some of the verboseness that comes with Lists. I would much rather have syntax like [1, 2, 3] than List(1, 2, 3). Also, indexing into a list with parentheses seems weird. Another area where Scala is more verbose is the Optional type. Typing Some("thing") for any function that may return null seems like too much writing for me. I wish they had sound some way to keep 'null' and still use the optional type. Perhaps if the optional type was implicit in every type? I'm not sure. 

## What I would like to learn more about
I would definitely like to learn more about list processing in Scala. There seems to be such a large number of list processing functions and I don't know what any of them do. I think they could be very usefull and save a lot of time if I knew how each of them worked.
