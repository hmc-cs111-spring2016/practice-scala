#### What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?

The several built-in functions made pattern matching recursion pretty straightforward (although learning these built-in functions was quite frustrating, more on this in the least favorite language design section). Much like Python, I found that most of the times I needed a pretty commonly used function, it would be built in. Scala also does a pretty good job of making code very compact, but at the same time very conceptually dense. I found myself thinking about solutions for a good while that ended up being no more than 2 or 3 lines. Even looking at the solution, it was difficult to understand exactly what was going on. Overall, Scala seems to be pretty general purpose, at least from my experience. 

#### What is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala made? Why?

Overall, perhaps my favorite language design choice in Scala is its flexibility. It makes sense that Scala has this feature, since this flexibility is quintessential for building DSLs. One specific language design choice that I found extremely helpful was type inference. As someone who has coded a good amount in Java, perhaps one of my biggest complaints is how verbose code can easily become. Because Scala is built on Java, I initially went about the assingment doing very Java-esque things in terms of syntax, such as explicitly declaring all my types as well as using the dot operator on almost function call. However, after looking at the sample solution as well as "elegent" Scala style, I realized there was a lot more syntactical freedom than I expected. For example, I found myself using space rather than the dot operator in my anonymous functions as it felt more natural e.g. (0 to 5) filter (_ > 0). Additionally, because of how flexible Scala is as a language, there are several ways to say the samething. For instance, although there is type inference, you can explicitly declare the type with a :<Type> following the function / method arguments. With that being said, I can see how Scala may not be the best language to use on a large company scale, simply because with flexibility comes issues related to readability. As someone who is just learning Scala, I can see how the allure of flexible syntax can get dull very quickly -- it was nice for me because code would occasionally compile even when I wasn't exactly certain of the syntax. With no clear consensus or conventions in Scala (that I know of anyways), at least to me, given the limited amount of experience I've had with Scala, it seems like it would be hard to 1) develop conventions that encompassed every inch of flexibility Scala provides 2) remembering said conventions. 

#### What is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?

My least favorite language design choice was the amount of built-in functionality. It definitely felt extremely overwhelming when Eclipse shows all the built-in methods. Again, I feel like this experience is unique to someone new to Scala, and probably doesn't reflect someone well-versed. For me, it was frustrating knowing that there existed a built-in function that did exactly what I needed, but just not knowing which of the hundreds available. It reminded me a bit of what Stone was saying in his article about how users could get overwhelmed if the language was too large. I was also surprised how scattered some documentation was for less frequently used built-in functions. For instance, I remember trying to find some documentation from Scala for foldLeft, but could only find third party sites that had extremely verbose explanations. Stackoverflow definitely saved me a lot of time in terms of these built-in functions by providing concise explanations with effective examples. It makes sense that the designers implemented these built-in functions as I would imagine a language designer using Scala would want as many tools as possible. 

#### What Scala features would you like to learn more about?

I think the most interesting feature of Scala is how it takes the middlepath between functional programming and object oriented programming. I'd like to learn more about how far Scala can take both these approaches to programming, and any parallels it may have with other languages (e.g. pattern matching is synonymous with switch cases in Java). More specifically, after looking through the provided solutions, it put into perspective just how many different ways there are to write a seemingly simple function in Scala. It made me realize the most obvious way to me may not be the most obvious way to others.
