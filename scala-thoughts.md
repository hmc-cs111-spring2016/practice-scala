One of the things I've noticed about Scala thus far is that it doesn't have nearly as much extra syntax as other languages. 
For example, there aren't semi colons needed or the word "return" explcitly written out. This is convenient for readability.
Overall, the list functions are also pretty easy to use. There's a wide variety of them built in that can handle many basic
functions. As for what's difficult, I'm not sure that I have a good sense of how the abstract classes work. That part seemed
a bit obscure to me.

As for the design of the language itself, I don't like the way the typing is set up when defining parameters. I find it hard
to read at a glance and quickly figure out what's going on. I would like to look into this more. I also don't feel like I
have a good sense of how to write conditions for some of the list functions, like mapping/filter/etc.
